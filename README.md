# Database control with python
Those three short programs were built by me and my colleague as homework for Decision Support Systems seminar.
Our tasks were to sort data, find max and min values, calculate mean, median and quantiles.

Shortly before doing those exercises I had read about basic semanthics of Python.
Choosing this language for the tasks helped me with grounding this new knowledge and challenged me to try myself in writing working Python code.
